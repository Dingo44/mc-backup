# README

This is a custom tool that makes a backup of a Minecraft world file.

This supports: 
- custom world names
- custom backup intervals (in minutes)
- removing old backups

Please make sure that your linux distrobution has `tar` installed, as this tool makes use of it to do data compression.

I recommend that you run this in a background terminal if possible.
